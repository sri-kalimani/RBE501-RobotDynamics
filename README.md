# RBE501-RobotDynamics

Refer to the Matlab folder for access to fully developed kinematics and dynamics for the Fanuc robot. Run Manipulator.m for kinematics until Lab 2. Run Dynamics_Simulation.m for dynamics in Lab 3. 

The developed student curriculum can be accessed at the Student Lab Material folder. This contains materials for Labs 1-3. Lab 4 can be developed using the provided Arduino code to control motor function.
