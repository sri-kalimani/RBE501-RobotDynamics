Refer to the Matlab folder for access to fully developed kinematics and dynamics for the Fanuc robot. 
	Manipulator.m is the full setup where all kinematic tests where run. 
	Quintic_trajectory_generation.m is used for motion planning. 

Refer to the Student Lab Material for the templete code for labs 1-4.
	Labs are seperated into folders with Peter Corkes Toolbox and emtpy stub files with a main template
